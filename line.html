    <p>Two points on line are endpoints, other two are control points for bezier curve. These two segments have C0 continuity at these endpoints. This piecewise cubic consists of one segment that is defined by the adjustable bezier control points, and another segment that contorts these control points for a unique curve. Try putting the control points on opposite sides of the curve!</p>
